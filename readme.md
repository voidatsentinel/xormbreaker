## XORmBreaker

Yes, XORmBreaker, like StormBreaker, that's what I called it. I built a very short script (more like the code in the Jupyter Notebook) when I was on an engagement in 2022, as I noticed repeating patterns in a `.bin` file which turned out to be a malicious `.dll` file. This code has since come in handy several times.

This solution is not perfect, nor is it meant to be, that being said I hope you enjoy the guide, and the tool!
